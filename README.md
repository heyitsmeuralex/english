# ENGLISH, a programming language

ENGLISH is a programming language where you can write code much in the same way as you'd write English sentences.

### How do I run it?

- Clone this repo & cd into it.
- `npm link`
- `english <file>.eng`

If you're working on a pull request, you can compile the nearley grammar with `nearleyc src/grammar.ne -o src/grammar.js`.
